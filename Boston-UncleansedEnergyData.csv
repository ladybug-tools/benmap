The parcel contains several buildings and is part of the West Campus.// BIDMC’s energy use/SF and Energy Star score reflect our energy intensive patient care and substantial lab research uses that have fresh air needs that drive up Btu/sf. BIDMC buys energy products from a district combined heat and power plant; such cogen energy savings is not reflected in this energy reporting platform. While new medical equipment and higher intensity clinical uses tend to increase hospital energy needs incrementally, BIDMC invests hundreds of thousands of dollars annually on energy savings projects (excluding LDC incentives). Due to projects undertaken since 2004, BIDMC saves  95,020 million Btu and 2,200 KCF of water a year.
